Well then. We had an, uh, explosion of activity over the past few days. Not, of course, on the work topic that so desperately needs it, but on web design stuff. You know, the thing that should probably be my lowest priority. Head <a href="http://mrandmrsphelan.com/nrri">over here </a> to see what came of it, then read this to hear what it's about.

So, I decided to finally put rubber to the road and rework the <a href="http://communities.nrri.org">NRRI website</a>. Again, it's hosted with GitHub Pages using Jekyll, but things got a bit more complicated this time. I had to stick with similar structure and features from the old site, which required a *bit* of extra lift. The biggest issue was creating category indexes, with post lists of just that category's posts. Turns out, Jekyll just doesn't do that. Jekyll's paginator only works from a list of *all* of your posts. I don't have the drive to pull all my sources together right now, but I had to scrap together a couple of different hacks to get post lists for each category of post.

Now, I should just leave it alone for a bit. It's doubtful that I'll actually get to implement the new page, and I've spent way too much energy on it already. I'll have to think of this post as a bit of a teaser; I've got a bunch of things to write about later on. The goal, now: forget about the page for (at least) the weekend.
