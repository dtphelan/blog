I'm[1] moving forward with an eye on Critical Infrastructure topics. Most of my ideas are cybersecurity-focused, but I'm trying to at least come up with some other options. The following "abstracts" are going out to commissioners and staff; their input will largely decide which one I focus on. These other topics may come up at some later time, but no promises.

# Designing Effective Cybersecurity Regulations: Concepts, Misconceptions, and Innovations #
Regulators have made strong efforts to learn about cybersecurity in recent years, but still do not speak the same language of technical experts in the field. This report would examine fundamental cybersecurity concepts, such as redundancy, the limitations of security through obscurity, and the importance of principled regulations. As a whole, the report would provide regulators with the knowledge background needed to create effective cybersecurity regulation; that is, regulations that are reasonably met, technically knowledgable, and engender safer cybersecurity practices.

# The Anatomy of a Cyber Attack: Weaknesses and Prevention Techniques for Critical Infrastructure #
Cyber attacks vary greatly in their targets and impacts. The critical infrastructure sectors face attacks that are both similar and dissimilar to other industries. The impacts of a cyber attack on an essential utility could be must greater than attacks on the average business, and the vulnerabilities that utilities must deal with are more varied and specialized. This report would describe some of the most common cyber attack vectors faced by the Critical Infrastructure sectors, methods for preventing and mitigating these attacks, and how these common attacks may impact a utility’s operations. The report would provide commissioners with better knowledge of the dangers that their regulated utilities may face.

# Critical Infrastructure Physical Security: State and Federal Approaches #
Recent incidents in California, particularly the attack on the Metcalf substation, have placed increased focus on the physical security needs of critical infrastructure. Efforts have been made to ensure the protection of electric resources from physical attack, including NERC’s CIP-014-1 requirement, but these attacks will remain a threat. This report will provide an overview of the physical security requirements placed on energy, water, and telecommunication utilities by state and federal entities, and will examine the standards and best-practices that have been developed across these, and other, industries.

I'm planning on developing briefs for the following. Once I do, I'll update this post:
> Data Privacy
> Information Sharing

[1]: I'm trying to move away from the royal We, although it's a struggle. I was going back and forth between We and I, and it was confusing. My other big writing habit is my usage of semicolons; don't expect that one to stop.
