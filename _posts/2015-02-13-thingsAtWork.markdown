The previous post worked so well that it's now the About page. Copying that is certainly much easier than striking that balance between I'm-so-great and I'm-so-down-to-earth that an About section always seems to need. Moving on. We're talking about work here, or, the thing that I'm distracting myself from by writing. We're in need of pacing ourselves today; it's already been (and will continue to be) pretty busy.

My company goes to the three annual meetings of our not-exactly-parent organization, the [National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC)](http://www.naruc.org), and one of those starts this weekend. Fortunately, we don't need to travel for this one, as it takes place right off the Red Line in DC. Still, we print mountains of presentations and papers, and generally have to be on our collective A-game when interacting with Commissioners. I've also gotten roped into doing graphics for a presentation on the EPA's 111(d) proposal, which has created a sizable amount of work. I'll probably throw some of those up here when they're finished.

I also had to draft up an op-ed for [EnergyBiz](http://www.energybiz.com), an energy-sector magazine/website/whatever the hell media wants to call itself these days. It's a pretty simple restatement of [my last research paper](http://communities.nrri.org/research-papers/-/document_library_display/3stN/view/0/15401?_110_INSTANCE_3stN_redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fcommunities.nrri.org%2Fresearch-papers%3Fp_p_id%3D110_INSTANCE_3stN%26p_p_lifecycle%3D0%26p_p_state%3Dnormal%26p_p_mode%3Dview%26p_p_col_id%3Dcolumn-2%26p_p_col_count%3D1), but in a much more succinct package.

Moving forwards, I think I have an idea for the next research paper. I already have a title (as that's clearly the most important part of a paper): Designing Effective Cybersecurity Regulation: Concepts, Misconceptions, and Innovations. I'm pretty big on the subtitle, even if I'm not convinced that putting Concepts and Misconceptions back-to-back is correct; we may need to find a synonym for one of the two. It really creates a whole narrative journey in just three words. Concepts, or, the boring part that you still need to know. Misconceptions, the dangerous part that eats away at your confidence. Innovations, to provide a goal, to promise a forward path for the reader.

Anyways, the idea of the paper is that regulators and technical experts speak very, very different languages. I've sat through a number of really cool presentations on honeypots and Stuxnet that are filled with cat jokes and internet memes. Simply, these things are not going to gain the interest, or respect, of the more traditional-minded utility regulator. So, a lot of things get lost in the divide. Basic security concepts, like [Kerckhoffs' principle](http://www.crypto-it.net/eng/theory/kerckhoffs.html), aren't understood by most regulators. This leads to some misguided efforts in creating cybersecurity regulation. I want to provide regulators with the knowledge background needed to create effective regulations; regulations that are reasonably met, technically accurate, and engender safer cybersecurity practices.

We'll see how that goes. Anyways, I'm back to the third (fourth? fifth?) revision of these 111(d) maps.
