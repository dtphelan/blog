Some utilities in Washington state invite friendly hackers to try to break into critical utility systems to discover cybersecurity vulnerabilities. The Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission encourages but does not require such testing, and also conducts its own on-site audits of regulated companies' security plans, according to E&E’s EnergyWire. Similarly Pennsylvania regulators require utilities to certify annually that their cyber and physical defenses are up to snuff. Even in sparsely populated Montana, regulators ask utilities to respond to a lengthy cybersecurity preparedness survey that NARUC prepared. The three examples illustrate how state regulators are responding to cybersecurity threats to utilities they regulate, documented in a recent report by the National Regulatory Research Institute. “Some states [are] super enthusiastic about it," said Daniel Phelan, an NRRI research associate who prepared the report, told Energy Wire. Other states, he indicated, not so much.
