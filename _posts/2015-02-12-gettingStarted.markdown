We're in the first stages of setting things up here, but the idea is to give myself a space to unload things I've been working on. Without, hopefully, that hesitation that usually comes with creative work, the constricting structure that articles on blog SEO tend to emphasize, or any one-topic myopia.

We've started by hosting this with GitHub Pages, a super useful service for putting things on the web with minimal resources (read: funding). We already have experience with the service from [mrandmrsphelan.com](http://mrandmrsphelan.com), a website with information about my upcoming wedding, and the ease of setting up project pages is excellent. [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) is going to be our site generator, and we were happy to start with the [Clean Blog](https://github.com/IronSummitMedia/startbootstrap-clean-blog-jekyll) theme from Start Bootstrap. Each of these things are easy to set up and have plenty of tutorial-style documentation, which is good for someone like me.

So, who is someone like me? Well, a technology-minded policy wonk. My day job is researching energy and telecommunications regulation, and my free time is predominantly dedicated to learning programming. Here, you'll probably see a mix of those topics. I'll be posting untested ideas related to my research, descriptions of (in my opinion) cool programming things, and, occasionally, I might even touch on some wider politics subjects.

Anyways, things will be moving around. I don't have a real end-goal for this, so we'll see where things lead.
