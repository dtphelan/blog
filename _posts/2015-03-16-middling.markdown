I feel like I'm thrashing around here, without accomplishing anything productive. I haven't *done* much of anything in the last few days. My weekend was dedicated to a midterm assignment; now that's almost done and I'm "back" to the nuclear assignment. You might be aware of how frustrated I am with that one.

I suppose that means that, yes, we have made progress on the midterm. I have a few questions left, but it's almost done. The impasse I'm at with nuclear retention seems to really affect my mood.

There's a soft deadline on that for Wednesday, so I suppose I'll have to buckle down on it for most of tomorrow. I'll also work on wrapping up the midterm. Hopefully, progress will make me feel better.

Anyways.
